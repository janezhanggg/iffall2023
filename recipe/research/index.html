                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring 5 cups of water to a boil. Once boiling, throw in the uncooked sago pearls and turn down the heat to a medium-low. Let the pearls cook for around 15 minutes (stirring constantly to avoid sticking/burning), or until the pearls are translucent and no longer white.</li>
                    <li>Once cooked, drain the boiling liquid and immediately rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>In a blender, combine together the 250 g of diced mangoes, coconut milk, condensed milk, and salt. Blend until smooth. You may choose to chill this mixture for at least 1-2 hours if you prefer the dessert to be cold.</li>
                    <li>Gently fold the mango-coconut mixture with the cooked sago pearls.</li>
                    <li>You may choose to layer with more mangoes or serve as is.</li>
                </ol>

                <a href="https://iankewks.com/mango-sago/">iankewks: https://iankewks.com/mango-sago/</a>
                <p>This recipe page has images for each step, which is helpful for people who may not be familiar with the ingredients or processes to prepare them. It also has a practical functions like a "jump to recipe" button that skips the description and goes straight to the ingredients and instructions and a "cook mode" that keeps the phone screen on so people can view the recipe while cooking without worrying about the screen turning off.</p>
                <a href="https://tiffycooks.com/the-best-creamy-mango-sago-only-4-ingredients/">Tiffy Cooks: https://tiffycooks.com/the-best-creamy-mango-sago-only-4-ingredients/</a>
                <p>This recipe page uses a consistent color palette that even the photos follow, which makes it comfortable to read and understand. It also includes milk alternatives, which shows an understanding of the end user (many Asians are lactose intolerant, so having lactose-free options on an Asian recipe site is considerate of the target audience).</p>

                <p>This recipe page offers a brief history of the origins of the dessert, which offers interesting context on how the dessert has evolved over time. However, this can be frustrating for some users who may not want to read so much on the history of mango sago and just want to access the recipe.</p>

                <h3>Design Links</h3>
                <a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/"> Uniqlo: https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/</a>
                <p>Uniqlo's site design is very simple and clean, but with select dynamic elements that add interest without overriding the visual language of the site. I would like to similarly keep my site clean and easy to navigate while adding a few elements to engage the viewer and emphasize certain points.</p>
                <a href="https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/"> AIGA Eye on Design: https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/</a>
                <p>AIGA's Eye on Design section is very intuitive and responsive to user movement with features like horizontal scrolling on select carousels. It also has some nice quality-of-life features such as changing the color of sections when the cursor is hovering over it, that I would like to take inspiration from.</p>
                <a href="https://esseninternational.com/"> Essen: https://esseninternational.com/</a>
                <p>Essen pairs serif and sans serif fonts well, which creates a more dynamic appearance while keeping other elements clean and simple. The cursor also gives a brief description when it hovers over linked elements, which is helpful for previewing pages without havinng to click into them.</p>
