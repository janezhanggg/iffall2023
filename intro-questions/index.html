    <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</li>
            <p><small>My name is Jane Zhang, and I am a junior majoring in Communication Design.</small></p>
        <li>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</li>
            <p><small>This class is required for my major, but I also want to learn HTML/CSS so that I can build more web-based 
            projects.</small></p>
        <li>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</li>
            <p><small>I took CSE131, so I have some experience with JS. I don't have experience with HTML/CSS, but I am taking 
            Web Development (which covers both languages) alongside this class.</small></p>
        <li>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</li>
            <p><small>I hope to learn how to translate designs into a usable, working website.</small></p>
        <li>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</li>
            <p><small>Designing for screen will probably require us to consider how different screen aspect ratios or window sizes 
            may affect the way our design works or how it is perceived. Meanwhile, paper is a fixed surface, so it is guaranteed 
            that the composition of your design as it falls within the edges of the paper will not change.</small></p>
        <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</li>
            <p><small>I think <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple's website</a> exemplifies effective design because although 
            it is very clean and simple, there is a clear system of distinctive elements and type choices being used. There is a
            clear hierarchy, with similar categories looking visually the same. It's also easy to understand; all of the most 
            common functions are pinned to the top of the screen, while relevant suggestions and ads are displayed on the home 
            page.</small></p>
        <li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</li>
            <p><small>I think <a href="https://open.spotify.com/">Spotify's website</a> exemplifies effective communication because 
            even though it uses conversational language, it is still clear what the function of each section is. They also keep the 
            descriptions of the most important functions simple and clear, and more complicated actions are represented by icons.</small></p>
        <li>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</li>
            <p><small>I think <a href="https://discord.com/app">Discord's website</a> works well due to how it can
            organize and congregate several different groups you may need to communicate with. Even within those groups, you can
            choose what types of messages you want to prioritize, and it gives users a lot of control over how they communicate and 
            who they communicate with.</small></p>
