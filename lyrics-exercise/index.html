        <p>Can't wait to meet you<br>
            So join the animatronic family<br>
            We open real soon<br>
            Try your best to hold onto sanity<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Come get to know me<br>
            And you won't wanna leave after tonight<br>
            Down here, we're lonely<br>
            And we would love you to join us for a bite<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            You've been through 20 long, frightful nights<br>
            You've seen their faces, felt all their bites<br>
            You know our show is so far from over<br>
            And Freddy told us you're an organ donor<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            All eyes are on you<br>
            We can walk you through our dark fantasy<br>
            Learn what we've gone through<br>
            We can teach you to laugh at tragedy<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            You thought the nightmares ended back at Freddy's<br>
            We're all still right here, so let's get friendly<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            We're feeling festive<br>
            Join the party, we'll try hard not to bite<br>
            Anger is restless<br>
            Don't hold it against us, we're alright<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The fun is starting<br>
            A celebration that lasts eternally<br>
            I'm always watching<br>
            Because somebody purple murdered me<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll be found down deep underground<br>
            What have I done to deserve this damnation?<br>
            Who knows if you're the one to blame?<br>
            'Cause we don't even know your name<br>
            But you're here now, and we've got temptations<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            We're only playing<br>
            Just wanted to make a few new friends<br>
            You plan on staying?<br>
            When you're with us, the party never ends<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            You might look at me, and think you're going crazy<br>
            I lost it long ago, you're not alone baby<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Can't wait to meet you<br>
            So join the animatronic family<br>
            We open real soon<br>
            Try your best to hold onto sanity<br>
